## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.

In this notebook we are trying to predict Dow Jones using RNN.

- What is the background of your project?

**Aim**: Use Reddit News Headlines to predict the movement of Dow Jones Industrial Average.   


* **Data Source**: https://www.kaggle.com/aaron7sun/stocknews 


* **Data Description**: Dow Jones details on Open, High, Low and Close for each day from 2008-08-08 to 2016-07-01 and headlines for those dates from Reddit News. 


* **Methodology**: For this project, we will use GloVe to create our word embeddings and CNNs followed by LSTMs to build our model. This model is based off the work done in this paper https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/C/C16/C16-1229.pdf.
